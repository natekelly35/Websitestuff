     <center><h1>Transformers & <br>Accessories</h1>
	 <article>Almost all models of Rockustics speakers can be manufactured with a
			matching 70 volt transformer built directly into the speaker. Rockustics
			transformers are built to exact specifications and will introduce less
			than 1 dB of insertion loss, ensuring that your audio experience is not
			compromised in a 70 Volt installation.</article></p>

	 <article>Protect your Rockustics investment with RSB1 security brackets. These
			brackets attach to the bottom of a Rockustics rock and provide a bolt
			hole that can be used to tether the rock with a cable or with a 3/8"
			bolt. The bracket can be easily adjusted to allow the rock to sit flat
			on a variety of surfaces, and is thin enough that it will not affect the
			look or performance of the speaker. RSB1 brackets will only work on 
			Rockustics Rock Series and Subwoofer Series speakers - they cannot be 
			used to secure Garden Series (Planters and OmniPlanters). Either one or
			two brackets can be requested at time of the order for your Rockustics 
			speaker. Please note that the brackets will only deter theft; they will
			not make the rocks "theft proof".
		<p>The bracket is made from 16 guage 304 grade stainless steel and will be
		attached to the rocks with stainless steel Torx pin security screws.</p></center></article>
